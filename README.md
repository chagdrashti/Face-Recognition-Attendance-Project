# Face-Recognition-Attendance-Project
 face recognition project in Python using OpenCV. Capture faces for training, use Haarcascades for detection, and employ the LBPHFaceRecognizer for recognition. Train the model on the captured faces and implement real-time face recognition. Develop an attendance system, saving attendance data with timestamps.
